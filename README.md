# Pure-Swift-Network-Layer
This is a simple app to show how we could use a simple, extendable network layer with Alamofire network interceptor with async await feature.

Features:

- Uses Alamofire Network Interceptor to handle errors and update tokens in the header.
- Uses the Swift async-await functionality.
- Manages the request API calls parts separately.
- Handles most network errors on the network layer.

Here is a demonstration of using this network layer:
